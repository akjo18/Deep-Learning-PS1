# Particulate Matter (PM) Concentration Prediction Using Deep Learnig Techniques

### Research Project for IIRS - ISRO

### Project Description
* Predicting the PM Concentration Levels accross different regions of the country with the help of satellite data as well as ground data provided by the organisation
* Dataset creation by converting raster image files to data points and combining the land and satellite data for a particular region.
* Training Dataset - 2020 , Testing Dataset - 2021. LSTM used for time series forecasting of PM 2.5 values based on values of other independent parameters. RMSE used to validate the model

### Libraries and Services Used
* MATLAB for extracting data points from image files
* Pandas , Matplotlib used for Data Preprocessing and Visulaization
* Keras used for the LSTM model used
